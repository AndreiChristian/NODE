# FIRST NODE APP

Maybe app is a big word here and this has nothing to do with building a backend so far. However, the key take away from this is that we can run Javascript code outside of a browser. This is the first step towards building a server.

#### How can we run this app?

Simply navigate into the project folder and run the following command:

` node app.js`
