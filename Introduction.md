# LEARNING NODE.JS

###### THIS LOG DOCUMENTS MY NODE.JS LEARNING JOURNEY

## INTRODUCTION

##### WHAT IS NODE.JS?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

#### What does open-source means?

Open-source means that the source code is avaialble for all developers. This is an important feature because it allows the community to contribute to the project and make it better by addig features and fixing bugs.

#### What does cross-platform means?

Cross-platform means that the same code can be run on different operating systems. This is an important feature because it allows developers to write code once and run it on different operating systems.

#### What does it mean Javascript run-time environment?

In order to answer to thsi question, we must first discuss what Javascript is and what the typical Javscript run-time environment is.

#### What is Javascript?

Javascript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is the language of the web. Its typical run-time environment is the browser. This means that Javascript code is executed by the browser. All modern broswers have an engine that executes Javascript. So, when it comes to the broswers, we do not need to wury about running Javascript code. The browser does it for us. However, when it comes to the server, we need to run Javascript code. This is where Node.js comes in.

So, now the definition "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser." is a little bit more clear. However, there are still plenty of questions.

#### How does Node.js execute Javascript code outside of a browser?

Node.js executes Javascript code outside of a browser by using the V8 engine. The V8 engine is the same engine that is used by the Chrome browser to execute Javascript code. So, Node.js is a Javascript runtime environment that uses the V8 engine to execute Javascript code. At the end of the day, we can say that Node.js and a broswer are similar in the sense that they both use an engine to execute Javascript code.

##### But, why would we want to run Javascript code outside of a browser?

One of the main reasons why we might want to run Javascript code outside of a browser is because we want to build a server. A server is a computer that is always on and is connected to the internet. It is used to store and deliver data to other computers. In order to build a server, we need to use a programming language. So, in order to make a server using Javascript, we need something that enables us to run Javascript code outside of a browser.

#### Node.js vs Broswer

Even thought they are both based on an engine that executes Javascript code, there are some differences between Node.js and a browser. The main difference is that Node.js is not a graphical environment. This means that we cannot use it to create a user interface. However, we can use it to create a server. So, we can use Node.js to create a server that will deliver data to a browser. This is the typical use case for Node.js. So, you cannot google stuff of Node.js but you can make stuff "googleable" with Node.js.(no idea if this is a word)

#### WHY NODE.JS?

There are many alternatives for building servers. Then why is Node.js a good choice? There are many reasons that could be discuseed when talking about why Node.js is a good choice. However, I will only mention a few of them. I will touch more of them as we progress through this learning journey.

##### 1. JAVASCRIPT

Javascript is one of the most programming language out there, and the most popular by far when it comes to web development. Even though, popularity does not automatically mean good, it means many things, such as:

###### 1. There are many resources available for learning Javascript.

This means that it is easy to find tutorials, books, courses, etc. that will help you learn Javascript.

###### 2. Great community support.

Chances are that whatever your problem is, there are developers who ran into it already and _pray to god_ they have posted about it on StackOverflow.
