<h6>WHAT IS NODE.JS?</h6>

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

What does open-source means?
Open-source means that the source code is avaialble for all developers. This is an important feature because it allows the community to contribute to the project and make it better by addig features and fixing bugs.

What does cross-platform means?
Cross-platform means that the same code can be run on different operating systems. This is an important feature because it allows developers to write code once and run it on different operating systems.

what does it mean Javascript run-time environment?
In order to answer to thsi question, we must first discuss what Javascript is and what the typical Javscript run-time environment is.

What is Javascript?
Javascript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is the language of the web. Its typical run-time environment is the browser. This means that Javascript code is executed by the browser. All modern broswers have an engine that executes Javascript. So, when it comes to the broswers, we do not need to wury about running Javascript code. The browser does it for us. However, when it comes to the server, we need to run Javascript code. This is where Node.js comes in.

So, now the definition "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser." is a little bit more clear. However, there are still plenty of questions.

How does Node.js execute Javascript code outside of a browser?
Node.js executes Javascript code outside of a browser by using the V8 engine. The V8 engine is the same engine that is used by the Chrome browser to execute Javascript code. So, Node.js is a Javascript runtime environment that uses the V8 engine to execute Javascript code. At the end of the day, we can say that Node.js and a broswer are similar in the sense that they both use an engine to execute Javascript code.


But, why would we want to run Javascript code outside of a browser?
One of the main reasons why we might want to run Javascript code outside of a browser is because we want to build a server. A server is a computer that is always on and is connected to the internet. It is used to store and deliver data to other computers. In order to build a server, we need to use a programming language. So, in order to make a server using Javascript, we need something that enables us to run Javascript code outside of a browser. 

Node.js vs Broswer

Even thought they are both based on an engine that executes Javascript code, there are some differences between Node.js and a browser. The main difference is that Node.js is not a graphical environment. This means that we cannot use it to create a user interface. However, we can use it to create a server. So, we can use Node.js to create a server that will deliver data to a browser. This is the typical use case for Node.js. So, you cannot google stuff of Node.js but you can make stuff "googleable" with Node.js.(no idea if this is a word)

WHY NODE.JS?
There are many alternatives for building servers. The why is Node.js a good choice?

1. Javascript

There are various advantages of Node.js using Javascript:
a. Javascript is a popular languages. This means that when a new project is started, there is a big selection pool of developers that can contribute.

b. Javascript is easy to learn. Personally, I consider that going in depth of any programming language and otherstading the more delicate concepts is never an easy task, and Javascript is no exception. However, compared to other programming languages, we can say that Javascript is a rather easy to learn languages.

c. Javascript is extremly important in web development. While there are many frameworks based on many programming languages for the backend, when it comes to frontend, there is a 99.99999% chance that Javascript will be involved.

2. NPM
NPM or Node Package Manager is a package manager for Node.js. It is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world. It is a command line tool that allows us to install, share, and distribute code. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. Why do we want NPM. This is because there is no need to reinvent the wheel every time we do a new project.
